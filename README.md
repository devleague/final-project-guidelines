    * Scrum / Agile

## Instructor Expectations
* Instructors are expected to assist students, but this project should be student lead. 
* Instructors will help set project goals, deadlines, and technical assistance as needed.

## Suggestions
The following are not rules, but suggestions based on previous successful final projects:
* The project should be sufficently challenging and introduce new topics to the students.
* Projects with a focus on data visualization utilizing D3.js.
* Projects wiht a focus on helping contribute to Hawaii or local government.
* The project should be about something all groups
* Avoid 'Hackathon' type projects. Must have depth, and must keep everyone in the group busy developing.

## Resources
- [Programmable Web](http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory)
  - With over "14,000" APIs to choose from, surely you'll be inspired. Beware of old apis or broken api links. YMMV
- [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/)
  - A civil-focused Api.
- [data.hawaii.gov](https://data.hawaii.gov/)
  - shaka brah.

## Misc.
More often than not there is data out there without an API for it. For example, there might not be an API available to retreive data about the [migration of coconuts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4_9kDO3q0w) but instead the data exists as an excel spreadsheet somewhere on the web. 

Now you can build something to consume excel spreadsheets which will then populate a database, you will then serve that data through an API you build. 

Wow, you just built a tool for other developers to use while also creeating the project you wanted! DOUBLE WHAMMY :sparkles:
