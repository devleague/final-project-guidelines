## Rules
* It cannot be a food or an events app.
* Teams should have 3 to 5 students (Depending on class size)

    * Groups are expected scrum one to two times a day.
    * Their will be a rotating scrum master - everyone in the group will be a scrum master at least once.
    * Scrum Master is expected to track tasks on a [waffle.io](https://waffle.io/) board.
        * Tasks do not exist if they are not on the board.
* The project must be able to be designed, developed, and deployed from start to finish with the alotted project time - This is based on the descretion of the instructors.
* The project must be developed only by the team members - not outside help.

        * API-Consumation / Exposing API
        * CRUD operations
* A Good DevLeague Project Has the follwoing (Pick 2):
  * **Data Heavy**
    * Lots of data, aggregates, D3, tells story, use of APIs
  * **Visually engaging**
    * Better than Meteorites, Not better than Norsecorp
  * **Interactive**
    * UGC, useful, fun, impressive

Pick 2 or more

    * Scrum / Agile
* OAuth2 (Optional if needed)
* Deployment
    * Linux
    * Digital Ocean

## Instructor Expectations
* Instructors are expected to assist students, but this project should be student lead.
* Instructors will help set project goals, deadlines, and technical assistance as needed.

## Suggestions
The following are not rules, but suggestions based on previous successful final projects:
* The project should be sufficently challenging and introduce new topics to the students.
    * Emphasizing and demonstrating ability to learn new skills
* Projects with a focus on data visualization utilizing D3.js.
* Projects wiht a focus on helping contribute to Hawaii or local government.
* The project should be about something all groups
* Avoid 'Hackathon' type projects. Must have depth, and must keep everyone in the group busy developing.

## Resources
- [Programmable Web](http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory)
  - With over "14,000" APIs to choose from, surely you'll be inspired. Beware of old apis or broken api links. YMMV
- [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/)
  - A civil-focused Api.
- [data.hawaii.gov](https://data.hawaii.gov/)
- [Awesome Public Datasets](https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets)
  - shaka brah.
- [Reddit `/r/datasets`](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets)
  - recommended to use search functionality.

## Misc.
More often than not there is data out there without an API for it. For example, there might not be an API available to retreive data about the [migration of coconuts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4_9kDO3q0w) but instead the data exists as an excel spreadsheet somewhere on the web.

Now you can build something to consume excel spreadsheets which will then populate a database, you will then serve that data through an API you build.

Wow, you just built a tool for other developers to use while also creeating the project you wanted! DOUBLE WHAMMY :sparkles:
